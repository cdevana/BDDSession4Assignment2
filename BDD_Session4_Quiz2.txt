Session 4, Assignment 2

1. The ___ is the heart of an HDFS file system. It keeps the metadata such as directory tree of all files in the file system and tracks the cluster where the file data is present. The actual data is stored on ___ as HDFS blocks.
	a. datanode, datanode
	b. resourcemanager, namenode
	c. namenode, datanode
	d. tasktracker, jobtracker
	
	Answer: c. namenode, datanode
	
2. When the end of the block is reached, ___ closes the connection to the datanode, then finds the best datanode for the next block.
	a. DFSOutputStream
	b. client
	c. DFSInputStream
	d. Resourcemanager
	
	Answer: c. DFSInputStream
	
3. When the client finishes reading, it calls ___ method on the close stream.
	a. read()
	b. write()
	c. shuffle
	d. close()
	
	Answer: d. close()
	
4. Which configuration file contains Environmental variable settings used by Hadoop?
	a. core-site.xml
	b. mapred-site.xml
	c. yarn-site.xml
	d. Hadoop-env.sh
	
	Answer: d. Hadoop-env.sh

5. Which MapReduce daemon instantiates user code, and executes map and reduce tasks on a cluster running MapReduce vI (MRvI)?
	a. NameNode
	b. DataNode
	c. JobTracker
	d. TaskTracker
	
	Answer: d. TaskTracker
	
6. Identify the function performed by the Secondary NameNode daemon on a cluster configured to run with a single NameNode.
	a. In this configuration, the Secondary NameNode performs a checkpoint operation on the files by the NameNode.
	b. In this configuration, the Secondary NameNode is standby NameNode, ready to failover and provide high availability.
	c. In this configuration, the Secondary NameNode performs deal-time backups of the NameNode.
	d. In this configuration, the Secondary NameNode serves as alternate data channel for clients to reach HDFS, should the NameNode become too busy.
	
	Answer: a. In this configuration, the Secondary NameNode performs a checkpoint operation on the files by the NameNode.
	
7. Hadoop administrators write a script called Topology script to determine the rack location of nodes. It triggers to know the distance of the nodes to replicate the data and configures this script in ___ .
	a. yarn-site.xml
	b. Hadoop-env.sh
	c. core-site.xml
	d. mapred-site.env
	
	Answer: c. core-site.xml
	
8. ___ is the master that arbitrates all the available cluster resources and thus helps manage the distributed applications running on the YARN system.
	a. Node manager
	b. data manager
	c. ResourceManager (RM)
	d. Taskmanager
	
	Answer: c. ResourceManager (RM)
	
9. ___  take instructions from the ResourceManager and manage resources available on a single node.
	a. NodeManagers
	b. data manager
	c. ResourceManager (RM)
	d. Taskmanager
	
	Answer: a. NodeManagers
	
10. How does HDFS Federation help HDFS scale horizontally?
	a. HDFS Feneration improves the resiliency of HDFS in the face of network issues by removing the NameNode as a single-point-of-failure.
	b. HDFS Feneration allows the Standby NameNode to automatically resume the services of an active NameNode.
	c. HDFS Feneration provides cross-data center (non-local) support for HDFS, allowing a cluster administrator to split the Block Storage outside the local cluster.
	d. HDFS Fedration reduces the load on any single NameNode by using multiple, independent NameNodes to manage individual parts of the filesystem namespace.
	
	Answer: d. HDFS Federation reduces the load on any single NameNode by using multiple, independent NameNodes to manage individual parts of the filesystem namespace.
